# CSS Series - Midnight Blue

Part of a series of work where I copy iconic graphic design layouts and make them responsive.

I will use SASS, and have more bias towards exploring CSS grid. Inspired by the amazing work of [Jen Simmons](http://jensimmons.com/) and her youtube channel [LayoutLand](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7TizprGknbDalbHplROtag)

Midnight Blue's album cover is from a collection of Blue Note Jazz which all have stylistic bold graphic design. Check out this video by [Vox](https://youtu.be/KNgA7dDs90E) to find out more...

Images maybe changed if I am unable to find a match, but I'll try and be as close as possible.

### Installation
